### Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

-   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
-   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
-   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [2,1,3]
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

**Input:** root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
-   `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`

# Notes
- The best way for you to think about this is that we are checking whether or not it is a binary tree on  the way down. If it ever fails to be a binary tree then we return false and stop checking. This is done by when going down the left we set the maxNode to be the root and the minNode to be passed down. We need this information to make sure we dont go under the current min (minNode) and that we dont exceed the root (maxNode)

# Run Time / Space Time
Run time - O(n) has to run through all the inputs to make sure what is happening
Space time - O(n)?
