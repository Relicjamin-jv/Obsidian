### Notes
- An arithemetic sequence is the sequence of numbers that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.
	- 1 2 3 4 5 is an arithmetic sequence
	- 1 3 5 7 9 is an arithmetic sequence
	- 1 2 6 7 9 is not an arithmetic sequence

-  Can get the sum for an arithmetic sequence by (first_element + last_element) * number_of_element / 2
	- sum([1,2,3,4,5]) = (1 + 5) * 5 / 2 = 15 
	- This only works for an arithmetic sequence
