### Description

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert _it to a **height-balanced** binary search tree_.

A **height-balanced** binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
**Output:** [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
**Explanation:** [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/btree.jpg)

**Input:** nums = [1,3]
**Output:** [3,1]
**Explanation:** [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
-   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
-   `nums` is sorted in a **strictly increasing** order.

# Notes
- It's already sorted so we can just take each respective mid and go ahead and put them into an tree. 
- The very middle node is the root of the tree, and each node that is the middle from the right or the left of the array is the next root of the subtree in each respective right or left subtree.
- Terminates by having the middle go out of bounds returning a null (Base case)

# Run Time / Space Time
Run time - O(n) -> Although we are running BS we aren't really reducing the search space since we are only trying to find the middle of each the left side and right side. So we still run over all the n ints eventually.
Space time - O(n) -> we do n amount of recursive calls
