### Description
You are given an integer array `arr`. You can choose a set of integers and remove all the occurrences of these integers in the array.

Return _the minimum size of the set so that **at least** half of the integers of the array are removed_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has a size greater than half of the size of the old array.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= arr.length <= 105`
-   `arr.length` is even.
-   `1 <= arr[i] <= 105`

# Notes
- A greedy solution works here, by taking off the most frequent numbers we can achieve getting to the half way mark with the set being the smallest it can be.
