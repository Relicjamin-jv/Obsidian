### Description
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of **the same length**. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` **exactly once**, **in any order**, and **without any intervening characters**.

You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
**Output:** [0,9]
**Explanation:** Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
**Output:** [6,9,12]

# Notes
- The general idea of this is too for each n times k length substring get each k length word in that substring. Then checking whether or not it shows up more than it should. If it does break, if it doesn't continue forward and if it is the last loop (meaning that it passed all the checks for how often a word should appear withing that n times k substring) then add the position of i to res (the index where the correct permutation of the words starts)
- For the first for loop it checks whether or not with the offset of the pointer i will we be within the bounds of s.size(). I is shifted one over in the string each time and is used to get the next k word in the second for loop.
- The second for loop gets the substr applying an size k offset for n there are (n comes from the var words)
# Run Time / Space Time
Run time - O(n*k) ->length of the string
Space time - O
