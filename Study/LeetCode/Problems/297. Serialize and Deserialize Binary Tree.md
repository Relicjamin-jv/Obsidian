### Description
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
**Output:** [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = []
**Output:** []

# Notes
- We need to run DFS on the tree to serialize it. This needs to be an inorder serailization or things can become a little interesting.
- We dont follow the order of the example given. for the example given with the code that we have written follow this
	- Output: [1, 2, null, null, 3, 4, null, null, 5, null, null]
- We used handy dandy functions such as stringstream, copy, istream_iterator, back_inserter, istringsteam, osteam_interator.
	- stringstream - takes a string and puts in into a stream so that we can interate over that string.
	- copy - in this case takes two istream_interators for the begining and end spot. The first one takes an istream_iterator(ss) to start at the position of the start of istringstream. The second one says to only go as far as the EOF (copy does a comparision to see if they are equal and if the copy should stop).
	- istream_iterator - Read successive objects that are passed in. Skips whitespaces by default.
	- back_inserter - passes values to the back of the container in this case a vector.
	- ostream_iterator - iterates over an object, second param is the delimiter
