### Description
You are given an integer `n`. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return `true` _if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 10
**Output:** false

# Notes
This is an interesting question to think about. This how to think about it :
1. Get the number we are looking at and turn in into an string
2. Sort the new string so the first digit is the smallest
3. Get all the powers of 2 and put them into an array of strings (you have to take the int and turn it into a string)
4. Sort all the powers of 2 so that the the smallest digit is in the front
5. Check to see if the number we are looking at is in the power of two array, if so return true;
