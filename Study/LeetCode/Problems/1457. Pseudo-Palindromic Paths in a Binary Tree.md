### Description
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be **pseudo-palindromic** if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

_Return the number of **pseudo-palindromic** paths going from the root node to leaf nodes._

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/06/palindromic_paths_1.png)

**Input:** root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
**Output:** 2 
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/palindromic_paths_2.png)**

**Input:** root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
**Output:** 1 
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [9]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 9`

# Notes
- Run preorder dfs, in this case any permutation of the subtree that is a plaidrome is good and we want that. So when at the root we add it to an unordered map and then run dfs on the left and right subtree. When we run into a node that has no children then we check if that subtree has a palidrome. To do this we check if there are more than one occurance of an odd amount of times a value shows up. If so it can't be a palindrome, bc we'll have nodes that cant fit and still make it a palindrome. However if there is one odd and no more then that odd can fit between the evens and still make it a palindrome. And if there is no odd then there is permuation of evens that make a palidroms (half of the numbers on the right and the other half on the numbers on the left).
# Run Time / Space Time
Run time - O(n) -> we still have to iterate over all the nodes
Space time - O(h) -> We at worst only have the height of the tree
